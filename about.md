## About Me
![Teaser image 1](./assets/bg2.jpg) <br/>


I am a Ph.D student at POSTECH [Computer Graphics Lab](http://cg.postech.ac.kr/).
My research interest focuses on the intersection of neural rendering and generative models.
I am advised by [Sunghyun Cho](https://www.scho.pe.kr/).
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (jinwj1996_at_postech.ac.kr).

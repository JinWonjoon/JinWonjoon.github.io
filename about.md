## About Me
![Teaser image 1](./assets/introduce.png) <br/>

I am a CSE PhD student at POSTECH [Computer Graphics Lab](http://cg.postech.ac.kr/) since 2021.
My research interest lies at the intersection of neural rendering and generative models, with a recent focus on video generation.
I am now advised by Prof. [Sunghyun Cho](https://www.scho.pe.kr/). <br/>

I will be joining Microsoft Research Asia as a Research Intern on September, 2024. <br/>

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (jinwj1996_at_postech.ac.kr).

## About Me
![Teaser image 1](./assets/bg3.jpg){: width="80%" height="100%"} <br/>

I am a Ph.D student at POSTECH [Computer Graphics Lab](http://cg.postech.ac.kr/).
My research interest focuses on the intersection of neural rendering and generative models.
I am now advised by [Sunghyun Cho](https://www.scho.pe.kr/). <br/>

I will be joining an internship to Microsoft Research Asia as a research intern on September, 2024. <br/>

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (jinwj1996_at_postech.ac.kr).
